<h1>Honeypot (Microsoft Sentinel Lab)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of setting up a VM, configuring Log Analytics Workspace, and configuring a Sentinel workbook in Microsoft Azure. The end result is a map that displays the geolocation of incoming RDP brute force attacks on a world map.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Azure</b>
- <b>PowerShell</b>

World map of incoming attacks after approximately 1 hour. Metrics along the bottom represent the number of attacks from each IP.
<br/>
<h2>VM setup</h2>
The virtual machine receiving all of the attacks is a Windows 10 Pro VM setup in Microsoft Azure. It has a custom inbound port rule to allow all traffic from the internet into the VM.

The purpose of this is to make the machine very discoverable from methods such as TCP pings, ICMP pings, SYN scanning, or any other method that may have its traffic dropped. This is done to increase the chance of the machine being discovered and attacked. 
<h2>Log Analytics Workspace</h2>
Azure's Log Analytics Workspaces is used to ingest custom logs. These logs are generated by the PowerShell script and contain geographic information that is used to plot data on the world map.
